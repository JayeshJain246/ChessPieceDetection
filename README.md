The game of chess was discovered over 2000 years ago. An ancient game of strategy which captivates the world even today. 
We intend to detect and recognise the chess pieces on the chessboard and assign a confidence score to each prediction.
We have use kaggle dataset.
We use a pre-trained model using YOLOV3 (You Only Look Once) which is used with ImageAI library and implemented using transfer learning methodology for custom object detection and recognition.
